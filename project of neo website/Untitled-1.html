            The base value is index 0 and the 
            difference between the two indexes is 
            the offset. For simplicity, we can
            think of an array as a fleet of stairs 
            where on each step is placed a value 
            (let’s say one of your friends). Here, 
            you can identify the location of any of 
            your friends by simply knowing the count 
            of the step they are on.

            In C language, array has a fixed size 
            meaning once the size is given to it, 
            it cannot be changed i.e. you can’t
            shrink it neither can you expand it. 
            The reason was that for expanding, if 
            we change the size we can’t be sure
            ( it’s not possible every time) that we 
            get the next memory location to us as free.
